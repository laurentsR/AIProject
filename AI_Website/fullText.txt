There are many techniques available to generate extractive summarization to keep it simple i will be using an unsupervised learning approach to find the sentences similarity and rank them. Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluid summary while preserving key information and overall meeting. One benefit of this will be you don't need to train and build a model prior to start using it for your project. It's good to understand cosine similarity to make the best use of the code you're going to see. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two nonzero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. And measures dakota not the angle between two vectors tanglewood e0az sentences are similar.
